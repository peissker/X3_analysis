# X3_analysis
Additional data for the analysis of X3


Data cube showing individual years between 2002 and 2018 observed with NACO in the L-band. 
The cube shows a cutout of X3 and is centered in the bright lower star to show the evolution of the X3 system. 
Above the centered star, a blob is evolving and moves with X3 toward the north. This implies that both objects might be connected. 
I recommend using QFitsView (https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~ott/QFitsView/) to inspect the file.
