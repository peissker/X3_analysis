# X3_analysis
Additional data for the analysis of X3


Data cube showing individual years between 2002 and 2018 observed with NACO in the L-band. 
The cube shows a cutout of X3 and is centered in the bright lower star to show the evolution of the X3 system. 
Above the centered star, a blob is evolving and moves with X3 toward the north. This implies that both objects might be connected. 
I recommend using QFitsView (https://www.mpe.mpg.de/~ott/QFitsView/) to inspect the file.


The two files X3a_blue_side and X3a_red_side are extracted line maps from the SINFONI data cube. Both fits files relate to the mentioned Br\gamma 
double peak. I recommend using QFitsView to analyze both files. Please select a contrast range of about 95% and blink both files. The measured velocity gradient
can clearly observed. Furthermore, it is obvious that the Br\gamma emission is not affected by the background.

The line-of-sight velocity of the red side is about +50 km/s whereas the blue side corresponds to -150 km/s. This results in a \Delta{v} = 200 km/s.
